## How does it work?

Swipe To Navigate  relies on the [Monkey Patch Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iocave.monkey-patch) to inject custom javascript in VSCode. After installation you should
be prompted to enable Monkey Patch. You can always trigger this manually by invoking the "Enable Monkey Patch" command.

## Why Monkey Patch? 
These changes were initially [proposed](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/82528) directly to `VSCode` but [this discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/82588) indicated that they're trying to limit further code that depends on `Electron` APIs

## Credits

[Monkey Patch Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iocave.monkey-patch) from [Matej Knopp](https://github.com/knopp) made this possible without direct [changes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/82528) to `VSCode`.
